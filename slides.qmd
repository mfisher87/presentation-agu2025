Hello friends!

Before I get started, this talk is going to have lots of links.
Please scan the QR code so you can follow any links you're interested in.

I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager.

I'm currently leading the GeoJupyter project at Schmidt Center for Data Science
and Environment at UC Berkeley.

I'm a maintainer of several open source projects, and maybe we've interacted
on GitHub before!
This talk is going to be about _JupyterGIS_, and I also want to mention
_earthaccess_, which helps you access NASA data in 3 lines of Python.
You'll hear more about this in an upcoming talk.

I'm passionate about open science, documentation, and design to minimize
cognitive load.

I also love dogs, gardening, and playing music on drums and keyboards :grin:

## :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks {.smaller}

* Community!
* Tools for thinking!
* **JupyterLab**: Modular and extensible architecture for interactive computing

![](/assets/images/jupyterlab-workbench.jpg){.r-stretch}

:::notes
Building on the themes of the previous talk by Fernando, Jupyter is more than
Notebooks -- in particular, Jupyter _Lab_ is a modular and extensible
architecture for interactive computing with powerful, reusable building blocks.

All of the items in the image below are what we call _extensions_.

For example, the `jupyter-collaboration` extension enables users to collaborate
on Notebooks in real time like Google Docs.
:::


## :people_holding_hands: GeoJupyter is a community!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things together!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
As another refresher, GeoJupyter is a community-directed effort to reimagine geospatial
interactive computing experiences _with the power of the Jupyter architecture_.
The project has many components including software, education, and
cross-collaboration with other communities.

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project, led by QuantStack, and that's what I'll focus on today!
:::


## JupyterGIS: What's the big idea?

:::evenly-spaced
:artist: **Human-centered**, participatory design

:open_hands: **Open source** and **open science**

:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like graphical GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
The idea behind JupyterGIS is to apply GeoJupyter community values, including
participatory design (allowing users to lead the way), and enabling open
science, to unify the good stuff from three areas of geospatial computing to
unlock new workflows.

We want the **approachability** and **playfulness** of graphical and desktop GIS tools;
the **flexibility** and **reproducibility** of coding or scripting methods;
and the **collaboration** and **storytelling** of the Jupyter ecosystem.
:::


---

![You got your desktop GIS experience in my coding environment!](/assets/images/chocolate-peanut-butter.jpg)

:::notes
These values have historically been prioritized in separate tools and
techniques, but we believe they go together like chocolate and peanut butter!

We also believe that the only way to succeed at this is for software engineers
and geospatial data practitioners to empathize and collaborate with each other.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter()
```

:::notes
We are building this community because working with data about our planet is hard.

So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

Let's talk about a few examples of challenges we've heard from those
practitioners.

Many of these challenges have existing solutions, but they often involve either
proprietary software or cobbling together multiple tools, introducing workflow
friction.

First, geospatial is hard, **even for experts**.

We **all** struggle sometimes.

## Brianna's story

[_When our community burned, where was the satellite information?_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-our-community-burned-where-satellite-information-pag%C3%A1n-phd-8rxwf/?trackingId=goJI9VniOZAI3RGuoPXysA%3D%3D)

-- Brianna Pagán, Technical Program Lead @ Development Seed, ex-NASA Deputy DAAC Manager

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore fire -->
I imagine there are many people here whose live have been affected by fire, or
know someone who has.

<!-- alex ignore her-him he-she fires -->
Brianna, a former Deputy Manager at a NASA Data Center, lost her home in the
recent fires in LA.
When Brianna learned her home was at risk, her first thought, like a true
scientist, was to look at the data.
Recounting these events, she wrote:

> I should be able to do this. I have a PhD in Remote Sensing, I have built satellite data
> processing pipelines, I help manage one of the NASA satellite data centers, I teach
> courses on climate resilience, adaptation and geoinformatics. […] and yet the irony is
> that with all my experience I could not access the information I knew existed to help
> our community.

:::notes
Many geospatial professionals feel locked in to certain tools when they want to
tell a rich story with spatial data.
:::


## Rich storytelling for everyone {background-video="/assets/images/scrollytelling.mp4" background-video-loop="true" .video-bg}

[_A Spark on Burned Mountain_](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2019/kincade-fire-origin/), SF Chronicle

Matthias Gafni & Kazi Awal

:::notes
"Scrollytelling" is the cute name that I love for those beautiful and rich
storytelling experiences you've likely seen from large media organizations like
the New York Times.

These are done by expert programmers and visualization specialists.
For example, Mike Bostock, the creator of the D3 JavaScript data
visualization library, was behind many of the New York Times scrollytelling
experiences.

There's also the option of subscribing to proprietary services with
story-building tools.

Why not open source?
Imagine writing a MyST Markdown document that becomes a rich scrollytelling
experience like this.
:::


## 📣 Andrew Bray & [Closeread](https://closeread.dev/)

<!-- alex ignore whitespace -->
:::{.center-content style="white-space: nowrap"}
There is progress happening in this space!
:::

:::notes
I want to give a shoutout to our Berkeley friend Andrew Bray who has been
pushing this problem forward with "Closeread", a scrollytelling implementation
for Quarto.

We're excited to partner with Andrew to develop a MyST implementation with
first-class support for geospatial scrollytelling.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter(2)
```

:::notes
Another challenge that we've heard widely reported by users is friction when
visualizing data about our planet from a programming environment, like a
Jupyter Notebook.

We've found many practitioners are perfectly comfortable writing code for
analysis, but visualizing data is an entirely different skill from analysis.
There's a wide variety of visualization libraries with unique and sometimes
frustrating interfaces.
It can be hard to choose, and each choice has a tradeoff.
Depending on the chosen library, practitioners may struggle to visualize many
datasets together, or to interact with the visualization in a meaningful way,
or to control the details of the visualization.

To get around this, practitioners described a process with many steps, like a dance.
We heard this so often that we gave it a name: "The GIS Bounce".
:::

:::

:::{.column width=35%}

::::::

:::notes
To do the GIS bounce:

First, do some analysis.
Then, write out a data file to check your work so far.
If you're working in a cloud environment, download that data file.
"Bounce" over to QGIS, load up a basemap, and then finally load your data.
Now you can do your validation and "bounce" back to your notebook, and repeat!

That's a lot of steps, and they are repeated every time many practitioners
check their work -- a common and critical task.

Checking our work shouldn't be frustrating and time-consuming, it should be
seamless, joyful, and rewarding.

:::notes
What about a nice interface that can display your many geospatial data sources
as layers in a Jupyter widget with some sensible symbology by default?

In this example, we pass in some gridded data with no settings, and some
polygon data with a request to display it as a chorolpleth map.

We built something like this in JupyterGIS, and we're continuing to evolve the idea.

:::

. . .

:::notes
Let's take a look at some of the things we can do with JupyterGIS.
:::

:house: All under one familiar roof (JupyterLab)!


## Explore data

:::notes
We can explore datasets interactively -- here we are inspecting attributes of a buildings dataset.
:::


## Process data

:::notes
We can perform data processing operations in a visual environment -- here we've calculated convex hulls of regions of France.
:::


## Browse curated layers

![The JupyterGIS layer browser](/assets/images/jupytergis-layer-browser.jpg)

:::notes
We can add layers to our map from a curated layer browser.
:::


## Discover data with STAC (WIP)

:::notes
We can discover data using Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs, or "STAC catalogs",
a modern standard for computer interface with data catalogs.

This is a work in progress that will continue to evolve over time!
:::


## Support for Xarray datasets

![Visualizing an Xarray dataset, tiled on-the-fly ([TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/), [David Brochart](https://david-brochart.medium.com/create-your-own-layers-in-jupytergis-cbb995a89b16))](/assets/images/jupytergis-tiler.gif)

:::notes
Thanks to the modular Jupyter architecture, we can build extensions on
extensions to compose cool new features.

Here we're using `jupytergis-tiler` by David Brochart of Quantstack, to display
data in an Xarray dataset on-the-fly in JupyterGIS.

Under the hood, the TiTiler dynamic tile server by Development Seed is powering
this functionality.
:::


## Collaborate

![Two users collaborating in real-time on a JupyterGIS project ([QuantStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzHYYCvWyu0))](/assets/images/jupytergis-collab.gif){width=100%}

:::notes
Thanks again to the modular Jupyter architecture, we can leverage
the `jupyter-collaboration` extension, which enables real-time collaboration on
Notebooks, to enable real-time collaboration on a map.

Users can leave Google Docs style comments, follow each other, and edit the map
at the same time, enabling new GIS workflows previously unavailable with free
and open source software.

# :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore just -->
You just saw some new ideas about how Jupyter's architecture can be applied to the geospatial domain.

We want you to think about this -- where can the power of Jupyter's modular and
reusable architecture enable new and innovative geospatial workflows?
:::


---

![[geojupyter.org](https://geojupyter.org)](/assets/images/join-us.gif)

:::notes
We'd love for you to join our community to share your ideas!

In our community, you can find folks with similar problems to yours, ask and
answer questions, and participate in designing the future of geospatial
interactive computing!
:::


## How you can join

{{< include how-you-can-join.md >}}

:::notes
There are lots of ways you can join our community and be a part of this mission.

If you can only do one thing, join us on the Jupyter Zulip, which is like an
open-source Slack.
There's a GeoJupyter channel there!
So many cool people are there, I promise you'll fit right in ;)

We'd love to talk to you about your needs, frustrations, and opinions in an interview.

It would be amazing to see you at one of our bi-weekly hackathons or monthly community meetings!
You can view our community calendar on `geojupyter.org` or by following the link on this slide.

JupyterGIS is available for install with `pip`, `conda`, or equivalents.
If you follow the link on this slide or visit the documentation, you can find a
link to try JupyterGIS in your browser without installing anything!
We're jazzed to hear what you think :smile:

<!-- alex ignore of-course special -->
Of course, we'd love to work with you directly on GeoJupyter projects, with
special interest in how you think Jupyter's modular and reusable architecture
can be applied to make geospatial data workflows more accessible and enjoyable.

We're excited to expand our **funded** development team, so if your company is
interested in sponsoring this work, please reach out.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me on Zulip, GitHub, or email.
