Hello friends!

I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager.

I'm a maintainer of several open source projects, and maybe we've interacted
on GitHub before!
I'll talk more about _JupyterGIS_ soon, but I also want to mention
_earthaccess_, one of my favorite community-owned projects I help maintain.
NASA data is behind a complicated API and authentication system, and
_earthaccess_ navigates those systems for you and helps you access the data in
3 lines of Python.

I'm currently leading the GeoJupyter project at Schmidt Center for Data Science
and Environment at UC Berkeley.

Before that, I worked in building software for research support and data
analysis, visualization, management, and access at the National Snow and Ice Data
Center.

I'm passionate about open science, documentation, and design to minimize
cognitive load.

I also love dogs, gardening, and playing music on drums and keyboards :grin:

Interactive exploration

Computational storytelling

Sharing and publishing
:::

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore just -->
You just heard about this from Fernando in the previous talk, but let's do a quick re-hash.

Jupyter _Notebooks_ enable:

* Interactive exploration, enabling development and thinking through human-computer conversations
* Computational storytelling, enabling rich and creative expression of ideas alongside computational analysis and results
* And sharing and publishing, where tools like MyST and Voici and initiatives
  like AGU's "Notebooks Now!" treat Notebooks as first class research
  publication artifacts.

![[The Turing Way Community & Scriberia (2020)](https://zenodo.org/records/3695300)](/assets/images/jupyter-scriberia.jpg){width=1001px}

:::notes
To explain what we hope to contribute to the geospatial computation space
(which already has some pretty great things going for it), let's pause and
remember something important:

_Jupyter is more than Notebooks._

It's a community that makes lots of cool stuff together.
:::


## :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks

:::evenly-spaced
Modular and extensible architecture for interactive computing

Reusable building blocks

Tools for thinking
:::

:::notes
It's also a modular and extensible architecture for interactive computing with
powerful, reusable building blocks.

For example, the `jupyter-collaboration` extension enables users to collaborate
on Notebooks in real time like Google Docs.
That's a bit of foreshadowing.
:::


# :question: What is GeoJupyter?


## :people_holding_hands: It's a communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things together!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
First and foremost, **GeoJupyter** is a community and a team effort with many players.

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project, led by QuantStack;
JupyterGIS is a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in similar ways to
QGIS, the leading open source GIS software, plus some cool new stuff.

We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is not limited to JupyterGIS.
Not everything we build is going to be a huge project or GIS-first.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.

Pangeo, and OSGeo.
:::


## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-owned effort to [reimagine geospatial
interactive computing experiences _within the Jupyter architecture_]{.jupyter-orange}
to enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data.

<hr />
:::

:::notes
Our mission statement describes us as an open and community-owned...

_Read the slide_

Maybe the first thing that jumps out is how broad this mission is, and
that's intentional.
We don't have all the solutions to this problem, but we know we can find them
by working with you.

What does it look like to **you** to **enable more people to confidently engage
with geospatial data**?

How can the Jupyter architecture help?
:::


## Our values

:::evenly-spaced
:artist: **Human-centered**, participatory design

:open_hands: **Open source** and **open science**

:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like desktop GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
These are the values that we feel will help us succeed at our mission:

We build and design in close partnership with users.

We believe in open source and open science, so everything we do is free and
open.

And it's important to us to create tools that unify the strengths of current
tools and workflows.

Desktop GIS tools offer **approachability** and **playfulness**.

Coding methods offer **flexibility** and **reproducibility**.

And the Jupyter ecosystem offers **collaboration** and **storytelling**.
:::


---

![You got your desktop GIS experience in my coding environment!](/assets/images/chocolate-peanut-butter.jpg)

:::notes
These values have historically been prioritized in separate tools and
techniques, but we believe they belong together!

But it's not going to happen by accident :smile:
It's only going to happen if software engineers empathize and collaborate with
geospatial data practitioners.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}

```

:::notes
We are building this community because working with data about our planet is hard.

So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

Let's talk about a few examples of challenges we've heard from those
practitioners.

Many of these challenges have existing solutions, but they often involve either
proprietary software or cobbling together multiple tools, introducing workflow
friction.

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore fire -->
I imagine there are many people here whose live have been affected by fire, or
know someone who has.

<!-- alex ignore her-him he-she fires -->
Brianna, a former Deputy Manager at a NASA Data Center, lost her home in the
recent fires in LA.
When Brianna learned her home was at risk, her first thought, like a true
scientist, was to look at the data.
Recounting these events, she wrote:

> I should be able to do this. I have a PhD in Remote Sensing, I have built satellite data
> processing pipelines, I help manage one of the NASA satellite data centers, I teach
> courses on climate resilience, adaptation and geoinformatics. […] and yet the irony is
> that with all my experience I could not access the information I knew existed to help

:::notes
Many geospatial professionals feel locked in to certain tools when they want to
tell a rich story with spatial data.
:::


## Rich storytelling for everyone {background-video="/assets/images/scrollytelling.mp4" background-video-loop="true" .video-bg}

[_A Spark on Burned Mountain_](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2019/kincade-fire-origin/), SF Chronicle

Matthias Gafni & Kazi Awal

:::notes
"Scrollytelling" is the cute name that I love for those beautiful and rich
storytelling experiences you've likely seen from large media organizations like
the New York Times.

These are done by expert programmers and visualization specialists.
For example, Mike Bostock, the creator of the D3 JavaScript data
visualization library, was behind many of the New York Times scrollytelling
experiences.

There's also the option of subscribing to proprietary services with
story-building tools.

Why not open source?
Imagine writing a MyST Markdown document that becomes a rich scrollytelling
experience like this.

:::notes
I want to give a shoutout to our Berkeley friend Andrew Bray who has been
pushing this problem forward with "Closeread", a scrollytelling implementation
for Quarto.

We're excited to partner with Andrew to develop a MyST implementation with
first-class support for geospatial scrollytelling.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter(2)
```

:::notes
Another challenge that we've heard widely reported by users is friction when
visualizing data about our planet from a programming environment, like a
Jupyter Notebook.

We've found many practitioners are perfectly comfortable writing code for
analysis, but visualizing data is an entirely different skill from analysis.
There's a wide variety of visualization libraries with unique and sometimes
frustrating interfaces.
It can be hard to choose, and each choice has a tradeoff.
Depending on the chosen library, practitioners may struggle to visualize many
datasets together, or to interact with the visualization in a meaningful way,
or to control the details of the visualization.

To get around this, practitioners described a process with many steps, like a dance.
We heard this so often that we gave it a name: "The GIS Bounce".
:::

:::notes
To do the GIS bounce:

First, do some analysis.
Then, write out a data file to check your work so far.
If you're working in a cloud environment, download that data file.
"Bounce" over to QGIS, load up a basemap, and then finally load your data.
Now you can do your validation and "bounce" back to your notebook, and repeat!

That's a lot of steps, and they are repeated every time many practitioners
check their work -- a common and critical task.

Checking our work shouldn't be frustrating and time-consuming, it should be
seamless, joyful, and rewarding.

What about a nice interface that can display your many geospatial data sources
as layers in a Jupyter widget with some sensible symbology by default?

In this example, we pass in some gridded data with no settings, and some
polygon data with a request to display it as a chorolpleth map.

We built something like this in JupyterGIS, and we're continuing to evolve the idea.

:::notes
Let's take a look at some of the things we can do with JupyterGIS.
:::

:house: All under one familiar roof (JupyterLab)!


## Explore data

![Inspecting attributes of a building footprint ([eo science for society blog](https://eo4society.esa.int/2025/10/16/jupytergis-breaks-through-to-the-next-level/))](https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-1-1536x922.png)

:::notes
We can explore datasets interactively -- here we are inspecting attributes of a buildings dataset.
:::


## Process data

:::notes
We can perform data processing operations in a visual environment -- here we've calculated convex hulls of regions of France.
:::


## Browse curated layers

![The JupyterGIS layer browser](/assets/images/jupytergis-layer-browser.jpg)

:::notes
We can add layers to our map from a curated layer browser.
:::


## Discover data with STAC (WIP)

:::notes
We can discover data using Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs, or "STAC catalogs",
a modern standard for computer interface with data catalogs.

This is a work in progress that will continue to evolve over time!
:::


## Support for Xarray datasets

![Visualizing an Xarray dataset, tiled on-the-fly ([TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/), [David Brochart](https://david-brochart.medium.com/create-your-own-layers-in-jupytergis-cbb995a89b16))](/assets/images/jupytergis-tiler.gif)

:::notes
Thanks to the modular Jupyter architecture, we can build extensions on
extensions to compose cool new features.

Here we're using `jupytergis-tiler` by David Brochart of Quantstack, to display
data in an Xarray dataset on-the-fly in JupyterGIS.

Under the hood, the TiTiler dynamic tile server by Development Seed is powering
this functionality.
:::


## Collaborate

![Two users collaborating in real-time on a JupyterGIS project ([QuantStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzHYYCvWyu0))](/assets/images/jupytergis-collab.gif){width=100%}

:::notes
Thanks again to the modular Jupyter architecture, we can leverage
the `jupyter-collaboration` extension, which enables real-time collaboration on
Notebooks, to enable real-time collaboration on a map.

Users can leave Google Docs style comments, follow each other, and edit the map
at the same time, enabling new GIS workflows previously unavailable with free
and open source software.

# :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore just -->
You just saw some new ideas about how Jupyter's architecture can be applied to the geospatial domain.

We want you to think about this -- where can the power of Jupyter's modular and
reusable architecture enable new and innovative geospatial workflows?
:::

![[geojupyter.org](https://geojupyter.org)](/assets/images/join-us.gif)

:::notes
We'd love for you to join our community to share your ideas!

In our community, you can find folks with similar problems to yours, ask and
answer questions, and participate in designing the future of geospatial
interactive computing!
:::


## How you can join

{{< include how-you-can-join.md >}}

:::notes
There are lots of ways you can join our community and be a part of this mission.

If you can only do one thing, join us on the Jupyter Zulip, which is like an
open-source Slack.
There's a GeoJupyter channel there!
So many cool people are there, I promise you'll fit right in ;)

We'd love to talk to you about your needs, frustrations, and opinions in an interview.

It would be amazing to see you at one of our bi-weekly hackathons or monthly community meetings!
You can view our community calendar on `geojupyter.org` or by following the link on this slide.

JupyterGIS is available for install with `pip`, `conda`, or equivalents.
If you follow the link on this slide or visit the documentation, you can find a
link to try JupyterGIS in your browser without installing anything!
We're jazzed to hear what you think :smile:

<!-- alex ignore of-course special -->
Of course, we'd love to work with you directly on GeoJupyter projects, with
special interest in how you think Jupyter's modular and reusable architecture
can be applied to make geospatial data workflows more accessible and enjoyable.

We're excited to expand our **funded** development team, so if your company is
interested in sponsoring this work, please reach out.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me on Zulip, GitHub, or email.
