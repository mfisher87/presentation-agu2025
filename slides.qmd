Hello friends!

I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager.

I'm also a maintainer of several open source projects, and maybe we've interacted
on GitHub before!
I'll talk more about _JupyterGIS_ soon, but I also want to mention
_earthaccess_, one of my favorite community-owned projects I help maintain.
NASA data is behind a complicated API and authentication system, and
_earthaccess_ navigates those systems for you and helps you access the data in
3 lines of code.

I'm currently leading the GeoJupyter project at Schmidt Center for Data Science
and Environment at UC Berkeley.

Before that, I worked in building software for research support and data
analysis, visualization, management, and access at the National Snow and Ice Data
Center.

I also love dogs, gardening, and playing music on drums and keyboards :grin:

# :question: What is GeoJupyter?


## :people_holding_hands: It's a communtity!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things together!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
First and foremost, **GeoJupyter** is a community and a team effort with many players.

**JupyterGIS** is our flagship project, led by QuantStack;
JupyterGIS is a GIS platform in JupyterLab that can be used in similar ways to
QGIS, the leading open source GIS software, plus some cool new stuff.

We'll talk more about JupyterGIS shortly.

But our work is not limited to JupyterGIS.
Not everything we build is going to be a huge project or GIS-first.
It depends on what our community (that's you!) tells us they need.

People have been succeeding for decades at advancing the democratization of
geospatial data practice with projects and communities like QGIS, GRASS GIS,
Pangeo, and OSGeo.

# :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks

:::notes
To explain what we hope to contribute to this space that already has some
pretty great things going for it, let's pause and remember something important:

_Jupyter is more than Notebooks._

Jupyter is a modular and extensible architecture for interactive computing with
powerful, reusable building blocks.

For example, the `jupyter-collaboration` extension enables users to collaborate
on Notebooks in real time like Google Docs.
:::


---

![[JupyterCAD](https://github.com/jupytercad/JupyterCAD) by QuantStack](/assets/images/jupytercad.gif)

:::notes
The same `jupyter-collaboration` extension provides the foundation for a
collaborative computer aided design experience in JupyterCAD by QuantStack.

Here we can see 3 users collaborating on a part in 3 separate interfaces:
One in a Notebook widget, one in standard JupyterLab, and one in a custom
application user interface built specifically for JupyterCAD.

All 3 interfaces are made from the same building blocks.
:::



## :question: What is GeoJupyter?

:::elevator-pitch
<hr />

GeoJupyter is an open and community-owned effort to [reimagine geospatial
interactive computing experiences _within the Jupyter architecture_]{.jupyter-orange}
to enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data.

<hr />
:::

:::notes
Back to "what is GeoJupyter":

Our mission statement describes us as an open and community-owned...

_Read the slide_

Maybe the first thing that jumps out is how broad this mission is, and
that's intentional.
We don't have all the solutions to this problem, but we know we can find them
by working with you.

What does it look like to **you** to **enable more people to confidently engage
with geospatial data**?

How can the Jupyter architecture help?

## Our values

:::evenly-spaced
:artist: **Human-centered**, participatory design

:open_hands: **Open source** and **open science**

:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like desktop GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
These are the values that we feel will help us succeed at our mission:

We build and design in close partnership with users.

We believe in open source and open science, so everything we do is free and
open.
Open source is the best.

And it's important to us to create tools that unify the strengths of current
tools and workflows.

Desktop GIS tools offer **approachability** and **playfulness**.

Coding methods offer **flexibility** and **reproducibility**.

And the Jupyter ecosystem offers **collaboration** and **storytelling**.
:::


---

![You got your desktop GIS experience in my coding environment!](/assets/images/chocolate-peanut-butter.jpg)

:::notes
These values have historically been prioritized in separate tools and
techniques, but we believe they belong together!

But it's not going to happen by accident :smile:
It's going to happen because software engineers empathized and worked with
geospatial data practitioners.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter()
```

:::notes
We are building this community because working with data about our planet is hard.

What we're bringing to the table is a holistic, human-centered, and
participatory approach to evaluating and improving this landscape.

So far we've conducted dozens of hours of user interviews to understand what folks need
most, and we'll continue to use the input of real people to guide our priorities.

Let's talk about a few examples of challenges we've heard from those
practitioners.

Many of these challenges have existing solutions, but they often involve either
proprietary software or cobbling together multiple tools, introducing workflow
friction.

-- Brianna Pagán, Technical Program Lead @ Development Seed, ex-NASA Deputy DAAC Manager

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore fire -->
I imagine there are many people here whose live have been affected by fire, or
know someone who has.

<!-- alex ignore her-him he-she fires -->
Brianna, a former Deputy Manager at a NASA Data Center, lost her home in the
recent fires in LA.
When Brianna learned her home was at risk, her first thought, like a true
scientist, was to look at the data.
Recounting these events, she wrote:

> I should be able to do this. I have a PhD in Remote Sensing, I have built satellite data
> processing pipelines, I help manage one of the NASA satellite data centers, I teach
> courses on climate resilience, adaptation and geoinformatics. […] and yet the irony is
> that with all my experience I could not access the information I knew existed to help
> our community.

## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

:::notes
Many geospatial professionals feel locked in to certain tools when they want to
tell a rich story with spatial data.
:::


## Rich storytelling for everyone {background-video="/assets/images/scrollytelling.mp4" background-video-loop="true" .video-bg}

[_A Spark on Burned Mountain_](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2019/kincade-fire-origin/), SF Chronicle

Matthias Gafni & Kazi Awal

:::notes
"Scrollytelling" is the cute name that I love for those beautiful and rich
storytelling experiences you've likely seen from large media organizations like
the New York Times.

These are done by expert programmers and visualization specialists.
For example, Mike Bostock, the creator of the D3 JavaScript data
visualization library, was behind many of the New York Times scrollytelling
experiences.

There's also the option of subscribing to proprietary services with
story-building tools.

Why not open source?
Imagine writing a MyST Markdown document that becomes a rich scrollytelling
experience like this.

## 📣 Andrew Bray & [Closeread](https://closeread.dev/)

<!-- alex ignore whitespace -->
:::{.center-content style="white-space: nowrap"}
There is progress happening in this space!
:::

:::notes
I want to give a shoutout to our Berkeley friend Andrew Bray who has been
pushing this problem forward with "Closeread", a scrollytelling implementation
for Quarto.

We're excited to partner with Andrew to develop a MyST implementation with
first-class support for geospatial scrollytelling.
:::


## :shrug: Why GeoJupyter?

```{python}
why_geojupyter(2)
```

:::notes
Another challenge that we've heard widely reported by users is friction when
visualizing data about our planet from a programming environment, like a
Jupyter Notebook.

We've found many practitioners are perfectly comfortable writing code for
analysis, but visualizing data is an entirely different skill from analysis.
There's a wide variety of visualization libraries with unique and sometimes
frustrating interfaces.
It can be hard to choose, and each choice has a tradeoff.
Depending on the chosen library, practitioners may struggle to visualize many
datasets together, or to interact with the visualization in a meaningful way,
or to control the details of the visualization.

To get around this, practitioners described a process with many steps, like a dance.
We heard this so often that we gave it a name: "The GIS Bounce".
:::

:::

:::{.column width=35%}
![](/assets/images/gis-bounce-hard.jpg)
:::
::::::

:::notes
To do the GIS bounce:

First, do some analysis.
Then, write out a data file to check your work so far.
If you're working in a cloud environment, download that data file.
"Bounce" over to QGIS, load up a basemap, and then finally load your data.
Now you can do your validation and "bounce" back to your notebook, and repeat!

That's a lot of steps, and they are repeated every time many practitioners
check their work -- a common and critical task.

Checking our work shouldn't be frustrating and time-consuming, it should be
seamless, joyful, and rewarding.

What about a nice interface that can display your many geospatial data sources
as layers in a Jupyter widget with some sensible symbology by default?

In this example, we pass in some gridded data with no settings, and some
polygon data with a request to display it as a chorolpleth map.

We built something like this in JupyterGIS, and we're continuing to evolve the idea.

# :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore just -->
You just saw some new ideas about how Jupyter's architecture can be applied to the geospatial domain.

We want you to think about this -- where can the power of Jupyter's modular and
reusable architecture enable new and innovating workflows in your domain of
interest?
:::


## TODO: Image encouraging/justifying joinage


## How you can join

{{< include how-you-can-join.md >}}

:::notes
If you can only do one thing, join us on the Jupyter Zulip, which is like an
open-source Slack.
There's a GeoJupyter channel there!
You don't even need to register an account to view activity, but we would love
it if you joined in :smile:
So many cool people are there, I promise you'll fit right in ;)

In the short-term, we're going to be participating in the community sprints on
Thursday and I'd love to see you there!

There are lots of ways you can join our community and be a part of this mission.

We'd love to talk to you about your needs, frustrations, and opinions in an interview.

It would be amazing to see you at one of our bi-weekly hackathons or monthly community meetings!
You can view our community calendar on `geojupyter.org` or by following the link on this slide.

JupyterGIS is available for install with `pip`, `conda`, or equivalents.
If you follow the link on this slide or visit the documentation, you can find a link to try JupyterGIS with JupyterLite.
JupyterLite is a fully-browser-native version of JupyterGIS, meaning there's no server and nothing needs to be installed!
We're jazzed to hear what you think :smile:

<!-- alex ignore of-course special -->
Of course, we'd love to work with you directly on GeoJupyter projects, with
special interest in how you think Jupyter's modular and reusable architecture
can be applied to make geospatial data workflows more accessible and enjoyable.

We're excited to expand our **funded** development team, so if your company is
interested in sponsoring this work, please reach out.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me on Zulip, GitHub, or email.

If you're going to the AGU conference in December, we'll be there too running a
workshop and session titled "Open Geospatial Workflows in the Cloud", hope to
see you there :)
