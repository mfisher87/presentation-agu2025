Hello friends!

Before I get started, this talk is going to have lots of links.
Please scan the QR code so you can follow any links you're interested in.

I'm Matt Fisher, and I'm a Research Software Engineer and Community Engagement
Manager.

I'm currently leading the GeoJupyter project at Schmidt Center for Data Science
and Environment at UC Berkeley.

I'm a maintainer of several open source projects, and maybe we've interacted
on GitHub before!
This talk is going to be about _JupyterGIS_, and I also want to mention
_earthaccess_, which helps you access NASA data in 3 lines of Python.
You'll hear more about this in an upcoming talk.

I'm passionate about open science, documentation, and design to minimize
cognitive load.

I also love gardening, playing music on drums and keyboards, and dogs :grin:

## :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks {.smaller}

* Community!
* Tools for thinking!
* **JupyterLab**: Modular and extensible architecture for interactive computing

![](/assets/images/jupyterlab-workbench.jpg){.r-stretch}

:::notes
Building on the themes of the previous talk by Fernando, Jupyter is more than
Notebooks -- in particular, Jupyter _Lab_ is a modular and extensible
architecture for interactive computing with powerful, reusable building blocks.

All of the items in the image below are what we call _extensions_.

For example, the `jupyter-collaboration` extension enables users to collaborate
on Notebooks in real time like Google Docs.
:::


## :people_holding_hands: GeoJupyter is a community!

![GeoJupyter is **not** software; it's a **community** which will build many things together!](/assets/images/venn-diagram.svg)

:::notes
As another refresher, GeoJupyter is a community-directed effort to reimagine geospatial
interactive computing experiences _with the power of the Jupyter architecture_.
The project has many components including software, education, and
cross-collaboration with other communities.

Because our work is led by our community, we depend on your feedback and ideas!
I'll share how to get in touch at the end.

**JupyterGIS**, the big blue circle, is our flagship project, and that's what I'll focus on today!
:::


## :globe_with_meridians: JupyterGIS: What's the big idea?

:::evenly-spaced
:artist: **Human-centered**, participatory design

:open_hands: **Open source** and **open science**

:cartwheeling: **Approachability** and **playfulness**, like graphical GIS tools

:feather: **Flexibility** and **reproducibility**, like coding methods

:performing_arts: **Collaboration** and **storytelling**, like Jupyter Notebooks
:::

:::notes
The idea behind JupyterGIS is to apply GeoJupyter community values, including
participatory design (allowing users to lead the way), and enabling open
science, to unify the good stuff from three areas of geospatial computing to
unlock new workflows.

We want the **approachability** and **playfulness** of graphical and desktop GIS tools;
the **flexibility** and **reproducibility** of coding or scripting methods;
and the **collaboration** and **storytelling** of the Jupyter ecosystem.
:::


---

![You got your desktop GIS experience in my coding environment!](/assets/images/chocolate-peanut-butter.jpg)

:::notes
These values have historically been prioritized in separate tools and
techniques, but we believe they go together like chocolate and peanut butter!

We also believe that the only way to succeed at this is for software engineers
and geospatial data practitioners to empathize and collaborate with each other.

# :globe_with_meridians: JupyterGIS {.nostretch}

:bangbang: Early development :bangbang:

![](/assets/images/logo-quantstack.png){width=50%}

:::notes
Let's talk about some of our work in progress now!

JupyterGIS, led by the awesome folks at QuantStack in Paris, is in early
development, so we'd love for you to try it and provide us feedback!
Remember, the project is community-led, so you can make an impact by sharing
your impressions.
:::


## :question: What is JupyterGIS and how is it different?

:::notes
_Read the slide_
:::

:::incremental
* Interactive GIS environment
* Jupyter- and browser-native (try it in JupyterLab/Hub/[Lite](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/)!)
* Python API for Notebook integration
* Supports QGIS project files
* **_Real-time collaboration_**: like Google Docs, but on a map!
:::

. . .

:::notes
Let's take a look at some of the things we can do with JupyterGIS.
:::

:house: All under one familiar roof (JupyterLab)!

![A screenshot of JupyterGIS](/assets/images/jupytergis.jpg)

:::notes
JupyterGIS is a JupyterLab extension.

Remember, Jupyter is more than Notebooks!
Here we see JupyterGIS running 4 different instances, one of which is in a Notebook.
:::


## :mag: Explore data

![Inspecting attributes of a building footprint ([eo science for society blog](https://eo4society.esa.int/2025/10/16/jupytergis-breaks-through-to-the-next-level/))](/assets/images/jupytergis-identify.jpg)

:::notes
We can explore datasets interactively -- here we are inspecting attributes of a buildings dataset.
:::


## :abacus: Process data

:::notes
We can perform data processing operations in a visual environment -- here we've calculated convex hulls of regions of France.
:::


## :shopping_cart: Browse curated layers

![The JupyterGIS layer browser](/assets/images/jupytergis-layer-browser.jpg)

:::notes
We can add layers to our map from a curated layer browser.
:::


## :crystal_ball: Discover data with STAC (WIP)

![Browsing a STAC catalog in JupyterGIS ([eo science for society blog](https://eo4society.esa.int/2025/10/16/jupytergis-breaks-through-to-the-next-level/))](https://eo4society.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-5.png)

:::notes
We can discover data using Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs, or "STAC catalogs",
a modern standard for computer interface with data catalogs.

This is a work in progress that will continue to evolve over time!
:::


## :1234: Support for Xarray datasets

![Visualizing an Xarray dataset, tiled on-the-fly ([TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/), [David Brochart](https://david-brochart.medium.com/create-your-own-layers-in-jupytergis-cbb995a89b16))](/assets/images/jupytergis-tiler.gif)

:::notes
Thanks to the modular Jupyter architecture, we can build extensions on
extensions to compose cool new features.

Here we're using `jupytergis-tiler` by David Brochart of Quantstack, to display
data in an Xarray dataset on-the-fly in JupyterGIS.

Under the hood, the TiTiler dynamic tile server by Development Seed is powering
this functionality.
:::


## :handshake: Collaborate

![Two users collaborating in real-time on a JupyterGIS project ([QuantStack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzHYYCvWyu0))](/assets/images/jupytergis-collab.gif){width=100%}

:::notes
Thanks again to the modular Jupyter architecture, we can leverage
the `jupyter-collaboration` extension, which enables real-time collaboration on
Notebooks, to enable real-time collaboration on a map.

Users can leave Google Docs style comments, follow each other, and edit the map
at the same time, enabling new GIS workflows previously unavailable with free
and open source software.

# :brain: Jupyter is more than Notebooks

:::notes
<!-- alex ignore just -->
You just saw some new ideas about how Jupyter's architecture can be applied to
the geospatial domain.

We want you to think about this -- where can the power of Jupyter's modular and
reusable architecture enable new and innovative geospatial workflows?
:::

![[geojupyter.org](https://geojupyter.org)](/assets/images/join-us.gif)

:::notes
We'd love for you to join our community to share your ideas!

In our community, you can find folks with similar problems to yours, ask and
answer questions, and participate in designing the future of geospatial
interactive computing!
:::


## :door: How you can join

{{< include how-you-can-join.md >}}

:::notes
There are lots of ways you can join our community and be a part of this mission.

If you can only do one thing, join us on the Jupyter Zulip, which is like an
open-source Slack.
There's a GeoJupyter channel there!
So many cool people are there, I promise you'll fit right in ;)

We'd love to talk to you about your needs, frustrations, and opinions in an interview.

It would be amazing to see you at one of our bi-weekly hackathons or monthly community meetings!
You can view our community calendar on `geojupyter.org` or by following the link on this slide.

JupyterGIS is available for install with `pip`, `conda`, or equivalents.
If you follow the link on this slide or visit the documentation, you can find a
link to try JupyterGIS in your browser without installing anything!
We're jazzed to hear what you think :smile:

<!-- alex ignore of-course special -->
Of course, we'd love to work with you directly on GeoJupyter projects, with
special interest in how you think Jupyter's modular and reusable architecture
can be applied to make geospatial data workflows more accessible and enjoyable.

We're excited to expand our **funded** development team, so if your company is
interested in sponsoring this work, please reach out.

If you have any questions, you can always reach out to me on Zulip, GitHub, or email.
